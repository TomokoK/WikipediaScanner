# WikipediaScanner

I was looking at the IPs assigned to my university when taking a break from writing a paper when I thought that it would be cool to get the statistics on our wikipedia contributions. This program takes a block of IPs and checks for contributions to wikipedia from each one and prints it to the console. I don't think I'm going to keep working on this but it's kind of cool.
